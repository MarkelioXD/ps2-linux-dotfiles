# ps2-linux-dotfiles
dotfiles for a linux ps2 customization



# keep this in mind:

* you'll need Compiz WM and use the Emerald Theme Manager
* you can activate the autohide in xfce panels if you want a cleaner look
* i used fastfetch, but i dont think there's a problem with other fetch cli, this is only important if you want a PlayStation ASCII logo on the terminal
* in the screenshot you can see i use Audacious with the OpenGL spectre analyzer, and a PlayStation Winamp Theme
* you can also install Viewnior for a lightweight image viewer
* you'll need the Emotion Engine bold font, you can find it online (https://www.dafont.com/es/emotion-engine.font)
