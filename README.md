# ps2-linux-dotfiles
dotfiles for a linux ps2 customization



# keep this in mind:

* you'll need Compiz WM (the apt one) and use the Emerald Theme Manager that comes with it (you gotta select the one at the bottom for emotion engine font)
* you can activate the autohide in xfce panels if you want a cleaner look
* i used fastfetch, but i dont think there's a problem with other fetch cli, this is only important if you want a PlayStation ASCII logo on the terminal
* in the screenshot you can see i use Audacious with the OpenGL spectre analyzer, and a PlayStation Winamp Theme
(https://skins.webamp.org/skin/d6e82f6eaeab96d353ca0890e6ac3a10/PlayStation2.wsz/)
* you can also install Viewnior for a lightweight image viewer
* you'll need the Emotion Engine bold font, you can find it online (https://www.dafont.com/es/emotion-engine.font) (i recommend using a font manager)
* the cli for resources seen on the corner is htop, you can get it on apt
* you gotta load the .profile file into compiz manually using the CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm on terminal)
just go to preferences, import and select the file i provided in this repo
* this is the font used in the terminal (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Google+Sans+Code)
* this is the used theme (https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1365372)
* i used the papirus-dark icons (didn't find a link)
* the font for all the system is called Inter
